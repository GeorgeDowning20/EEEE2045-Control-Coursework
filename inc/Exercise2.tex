Figure~\ref{fig:\ex}. shows the step response of the system for different values of $a$. The steady state gain of the system is $a/a$ which is equal to 1 for all values of $a$. The time constant of the system is shown in Table~\ref{tab:\ex}. The time constant is equal to the reciprocal of the denominator at steady state. Hence the time constant is equal to $1/a$ at all values of $a$.\\

\end{equation}

Figure~\ref{fig:\ex_2}. shows the step response of the transfer function shown in \eqref{eq:\ex_2}. where the plant has a positive pole the system is unstable and will not converge to a steady state. the rate of change of the system is increasing and will continue to increase until the system is destroyed.
